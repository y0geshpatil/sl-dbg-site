# sl-dbg — Command Reference

All commands accept `--json` (default), `--pretty`, `--quiet`, `--session <id>`, `--timeout <duration>`.

Default output is JSON. Errors go to stderr; structured payload on stdout.

## Global

### `sl-dbg version`
```json
{"version":"0.1.0","commit":"abc1234","date":"2026-06-26T13:00:00Z"}
```

### `sl-dbg help [command]`
Standard cobra help.

### `sl-dbg adapters`
List registered language adapters and detection status.
```json
{"ok":true,"data":{"adapters":[
  {"lang":"python","installed":true,"version":"1.8.0","path":"/usr/bin/python -m debugpy.adapter"},
  {"lang":"java","installed":false,"hint":"sl-dbg install-adapter java"}
]}}
```

### `sl-dbg install-adapter <python|go|java|all> [--force]`
Install the selected adapter; `all` attempts all three and returns an error if
any fail. Python uses an existing debugpy installation or a managed virtual
environment; Go installs Delve; released Java binaries download the same-version
JAR and mandatory SHA-256 sidecar. `--force` refreshes an existing adapter.
See [ADAPTERS.md](ADAPTERS.md) for prerequisite/runtime detection and cache paths.

### `sl-dbg daemon [serve|stop|status|logs]`
Direct daemon control. Normally implicit. `stop` never starts an absent daemon.
It waits up to five seconds for the acknowledged daemon to release its endpoint
and exit before returning; failure is actionable, not silently ignored. A
replacement daemon's endpoint/PID is left alone. If already stopped, the response
data is `{"shutdown":"not running"}`.

### `sl-dbg mcp`
Run the MCP server over stdio. `tools/list` is the authoritative schema for the
running binary. Safe mode is the default; evaluation is disabled unless explicitly
enabled. See [AGENT-GUIDE.md](AGENT-GUIDE.md).

### `sl-dbg mcp install <agent>` / `sl-dbg mcp uninstall <agent>`
Supported clients: `claude` (Desktop), `cursor`, `vscode` (current workspace),
`codex`, `copilot`, and `all` (detected clients). `--dry-run` previews changes;
install `--print` emits snippets without writing; `--force` explicitly replaces
an existing entry. Configs are backed up before atomic updates. Any failed client
update makes the command fail, even if other clients were updated successfully.

VS Code uses `.vscode/mcp.json` with a `servers` object. Copilot CLI uses
`~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` with `mcpServers`. Registrations use the installed
binary's absolute path; rerun with `--force` after moving the binary. TOML forms
that cannot be safely edited are refused; use the printed snippet to edit manually.

The proposed TOML application config is not loaded yet; see
[CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md). There is no `sl-dbg config` subcommand.

## Session Lifecycle

### `sl-dbg start --lang <L> --program <path> [opts]`
Launch a new debug session by starting the program.

Flags:
- `--lang` — required (python, java, go)
- `--program` — path to entrypoint
- `--args "<args>"` — arguments passed to the program
- `--cwd <dir>` — working directory
- `--env KEY=val` (repeatable) — environment
- `--stop-on-entry` — pause at first line
- `--source-root <dir>` (repeatable)
- `--read-only` — forbid state mutation
- `--name` — optional unique session name; each new session becomes the default

Response:
```json
{"ok":true,"data":{"session":"a1b2","state":"paused","reason":"entry",
  "location":{"file":"app.py","line":1}}}
```

### `sl-dbg attach --lang <L> [--host H --port P | --pid N] [opts]`
Attach to an already-running process.
```bash
sl-dbg attach --lang java --host localhost --port 5005
sl-dbg attach --lang python --pid 12345
```

### `sl-dbg listen [--timeout <duration>]`
Wait for the current session to pause or terminate. This is not a reverse-attach
network listener. If already paused or terminated, return the current stop
immediately. Entry pauses that arrive during adapter launch are retained.

### `sl-dbg sessions`
List all active sessions.
```json
{"ok":true,"data":{"sessions":[
  {"id":"a1b2","lang":"python","state":"paused","program":"app.py","default":true},
  {"id":"c3d4","lang":"java","state":"running","attached":"svc.prod:5005"}
]}}
```

### `sl-dbg use <session-id>`
Set the default session for subsequent commands.

### `sl-dbg stop [<id>]`
Disconnect and terminate. With `--detach`, leaves target running (attach mode only).

### `sl-dbg restart [<id>]`
Restart the target.

### `sl-dbg state [<id>]`
Non-blocking: returns current session state.
```json
{"ok":true,"data":{"state":"paused","reason":"breakpoint",
  "location":{"file":"app.py","line":42,"function":"login"},
  "thread":1}}
```
When the session has terminated, `location`, `thread`, and the pause `reason` are intentionally omitted — only the terminal facts survive:
```json
{"ok":true,"data":{"state":"exited","reason":"exited","exitCode":0}}
```
If the adapter (or target through the adapter) died from an OS signal, the response surfaces it explicitly so callers don't have to decode an "exit code looks signal-shaped" heuristic:
```json
{"ok":true,"data":{"state":"terminated","reason":"signal","signal":"killed","exitCode":137}}
```
`sl-dbg listen` returns the same terminal shape when invoked against an already-exited/terminated session — `state` and `listen` never disagree on `reason`, `exitCode`, or `signal` for the same session.

---

## Breakpoints

### `sl-dbg break <location> [opts]`
Add a line breakpoint. Location: `file:line` or `Class:line` or `package.Class:line`.

Flags:
- `--if <expr>` — conditional
- `--hit <N>` — break on Nth hit
- `--log "<msg>"` — logpoint (no pause; prints msg with `{var}` interpolation)
- `--once` — auto-remove after first hit

```json
{"ok":true,"data":{"breakpoint":{"id":1,"verified":true,"file":"app.py","line":42}}}
```

### `sl-dbg break-fn <function>`
Function-entry breakpoint.
```bash
sl-dbg break-fn com.example.UserService.login
sl-dbg break-fn app.process_order
```

For Java, both `Class.method` and `Class#method` are accepted; the daemon
translates the final `.` to `#` (the form java-debug requires internally) and
strips any `(arg-types)` signature suffix. Fully-qualified class names
(`pkg.sub.Class.method`) work the same way.

### `sl-dbg break-ex <ExceptionType> [--uncaught | --caught | --all]`
Exception breakpoint.
```bash
sl-dbg break-ex NullPointerException --uncaught
sl-dbg break-ex ValueError --all
```

### `sl-dbg watch [--add <expression> | --remove <id> | --remove-all]`
List, add, or remove persistent watch expressions. Watches are evaluated while
paused; they do not set data breakpoints and require evaluation permission to add.
```bash
sl-dbg watch --add user.balance
```

### `sl-dbg breaks`
List all breakpoints.

### `sl-dbg unbreak <id> [...]`
Remove one or more. `--all` removes all.

---

## Execution Control

All execution commands block until the target pauses again (or `--timeout` fires).

### `sl-dbg run`
Run from start (after `start --stop-on-entry`).

### `sl-dbg continue` (alias: `c`)
Resume until next pause.

### `sl-dbg step` (alias: `si`)
Step into.

### `sl-dbg next` (alias: `n`)
Step over.

### `sl-dbg finish` (alias: `out`)
Step out of current frame.

### `sl-dbg until <line>`
Continue until reaching line (auto-removes after).

### `sl-dbg pause`
Pause a running target.

Common response:
```json
{"ok":true,"data":{"state":"paused","reason":"breakpoint",
  "location":{"file":"app.py","line":42,"function":"login"},
  "thread":1,"hitBreakpoint":1}}
```

---

## Inspection

### `sl-dbg stack [--thread <id>] [--limit N]`
Call stack.
```json
{"ok":true,"data":{"frames":[
  {"id":1000,"name":"login","file":"app.py","line":42},
  {"id":1001,"name":"main","file":"app.py","line":88}
]}}
```

### `sl-dbg threads`
List all threads.

### `sl-dbg locals [--frame N]`
Local variables. Returns recursive structure or shallow with `objectId` refs.
```json
{"ok":true,"data":{"locals":{
  "user":{"type":"User","value":"<User id=5>","ref":1002,"expandable":true},
  "items":{"type":"list","value":"[1, 2, 3]","ref":1003}
}}}
```

### `sl-dbg globals [--frame N]`
Global / module-level variables.

### `sl-dbg fields <ref>`
Expand a previously returned object reference.

### `sl-dbg eval <expression> [--frame N]`
Evaluate an expression in the current (or specified) frame. **Refused on `--read-only` sessions** (issue #56) because expression-form evaluation in every supported language permits arbitrary side effects (`__import__('os').system(...)`, static-method calls, etc.); the DAP `context: "watch"` hint is advisory, not a sandbox. Start a new session without `--read-only` if you need eval.
```json
{"ok":true,"data":{"result":"7","type":"int"}}
```

### `sl-dbg set <name> <value> [--frame N]`
Modify a variable.

### `sl-dbg source [--frame N] [--around L]`
Source code around current line. May also be invoked with `--file <path>` and `--line <n>` to view a specific location.

**Security:** the daemon only returns files that resolve under the session's source-root allowlist — explicit `--source-root` values, the launch cwd, the program directory, files containing registered breakpoints, and the current pause location. When `SL_DBG_ALLOW_SOURCE_ROOT` is set, paths under those directories are also accepted. Paths containing `..` segments are rejected unconditionally. Anything else returns `SOURCE_PATH_DENIED`. This prevents `source --file` from being used as an arbitrary-file-read primitive against the daemon user, even in `--read-only` sessions. Issue #57.

### `sl-dbg snapshot`
Full state dump: stack + locals for every frame + globals + watches. Best command for an agent to "see everything" at a pause point.
```json
{"ok":true,"data":{
  "state":"paused","location":{...},
  "threads":[...],"frames":[...],
  "locals":{...},"globals":{...},
  "watches":[...],"exception":null
}}
```

---

## Output & Events

### `sl-dbg output [--stdout | --stderr | --all] [--follow]`
Drain target's captured stdout/stderr.

### `sl-dbg events [--follow] [--since <ts>]`
Stream raw debug events (stopped, output, module, breakpoint, …) as JSON Lines.

### `sl-dbg logs`
Daemon log tail (for debugging sl-dbg itself).

---

## Not implemented

Reverse execution, `goto`, data breakpoints, module/exception inspection commands,
memory/disassembly commands, and breakpoint enable/disable commands are not
registered. They are design/roadmap topics, not supported CLI interfaces.

---

## Output Envelope (Standard)

Every JSON response has this shape:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": { /* command-specific */ },
  "session": "a1b2",
  "state": "paused|running|exited|terminated",
  "ts": "2026-06-26T13:00:00Z"
}
```

Or on error:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "STABLE_ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "human readable",
    "details": {},
    "hint": "what to try next"
  },
  "session": "a1b2",
  "ts": "..."
}
```

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Debugger error (BP not verified, target crashed) |
| 2 | Usage error |
| 3 | IPC error (daemon down) |
| 4 | Adapter error |
| 130 | Interrupted |

## Error Code Taxonomy

`error.code` values are stable identifiers tools can switch on. The set is intentionally small and additive — see [issues](https://github.com/y0geshpatil/sl-dbg/issues) tagged `area/proto` for proposed additions.

| Code | When | Hint |
|---|---|---|
| `USAGE_ERROR` | Bad CLI / JSON args (empty expression, missing file, line past EOF) | Validate input |
| `SESSION_NOT_FOUND` | Session id unknown / already stopped | Call `debug_sessions` |
| `READ_ONLY_MODE` | Mutating call against `--read-only` session | Start a new mutating session |
| `LAUNCH_FAILED` | Program died before any user command could run; **only when exit code ≠ 0**. Clean `exit 0` returns `state=exited` as success | Inspect `stderr`/`stdout` tails |
| `ADAPTER_FAILED` | Generic uncategorised adapter error | Last resort |
| `MISSING_DEBUG_INFO` | `AbsentInformationException` — class compiled without `-g` | `javac -g` |
| `CLASS_NOT_LOADED` | BP at a class the JVM hasn't loaded | Set BP earlier |
| `STALE_FRAME` | Frame invalidated after resume | Re-fetch stack |
| `VM_DISCONNECTED` | JVM terminated | New session |
| `EVAL_NO_THIS` | `this` in static/native frame | Use `Class.field` |
| `EVAL_NAME_UNKNOWN` | Identifier not in scope | Qualify with class |
| `EVAL_SYNTAX_ERROR` | Expression parse error | Fix syntax |
| `EVAL_RUNTIME_EXCEPTION` | Expression evaluated to a runtime exception (NPE, divide-by-zero, ClassCast) | Guard the receiver |
| `BREAKPOINT_UNVERIFIED` | `debug_inspect_at`: BP didn't bind | Pick an executable body line |
| `INSPECT_NOT_PAUSED` | `debug_inspect_at`: continue ended in exit/timeout, not the requested BP | Confirm reachability |
| `PAUSE_TIMEOUT` | Adapter accepted pause but did not stop within 10s | Set a line BP and continue instead |
| `TIMEOUT` | Operation exceeded its `--timeout` | Raise `--timeout` |
| `PROGRAM_NOT_ALLOWED` | `debug_start`: program path not in `SL_DBG_ALLOW_PROGRAM` allowlist | Add program to allowlist or unset env var |
| `SOURCE_PATH_DENIED` | `debug_source`: file not under the session's source roots (program dir, `--source-root`, registered breakpoint files, current pause location), and not under `SL_DBG_ALLOW_SOURCE_ROOT` either — or path contained a `..` segment | Pass an absolute path under the session's roots, set a breakpoint in the file first, add `--source-root`, or set `SL_DBG_ALLOW_SOURCE_ROOT` |
| `EVAL_DISABLED` | `debug_eval` / `debug_set` / `debug_watch add` / `debug_break --condition`: the daemon is running without `SL_DBG_ALLOW_EVAL=1` (default-deny). `sl-dbg mcp --safe` exports this by default; pass `--allow-eval` to re-enable. | Restart the daemon with `SL_DBG_ALLOW_EVAL=1` (and `SL_DBG_AUDIT_LOG=…` for an audit trail) |
| `EVAL_DENIED` | `debug_eval`: expression matched `SL_DBG_DENY_EVAL_PATTERNS`. **Not a security boundary** — see `SL_DBG_ALLOW_EVAL`. | Rephrase, or set `SL_DBG_DENY_EVAL_PATTERNS=-` |
| `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | `debug_start`/`debug_attach`: daemon at `SL_DBG_MAX_SESSIONS` cap | Stop another session or raise the cap |

### Security policy (env vars)

The daemon reads these at startup. All are optional; defaults preserve legacy behavior. See [docs/SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model.

| Env var | Purpose | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| `SL_DBG_ALLOW_PROGRAM` | Colon-separated glob allowlist for `start --program` paths. Globs match either the full path or basename. | #21 |
| `SL_DBG_ALLOW_SOURCE_ROOT` | Colon-separated absolute-path roots that `debug_source` may read **in addition** to the session's own trusted roots. The session's `sourceRoots`/`cwd`/program dir, registered breakpoint files, and current pause location are always trusted; everything else is denied with `SOURCE_PATH_DENIED`. Paths with `..` segments are rejected unconditionally. | #18, #57 |
| `SL_DBG_MAX_SESSIONS` | Cap on concurrent sessions in the daemon. `0` (default) = unlimited. | #22 |
| `SL_DBG_AUDIT_LOG` | Path. When set, every `start`/`attach`/`eval`/`set` is appended as one NDJSON line (`ts`, `event`, `session`, `args`). | #23 |
| `SL_DBG_ALLOW_EVAL` | Boolean (`1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`). When unset or falsy (**default**), every code-evaluating command — `debug_eval`, `debug_set`, `debug_watch add`, and any `debug_break*` with `--condition` — is rejected with `EVAL_DISABLED`. This is the only real security boundary against LLM-driven MCP callers; the daemon cannot tell CLI vs MCP traffic apart on the socket, so the knob is daemon-wide. `sl-dbg mcp --safe` exports `SL_DBG_ALLOW_EVAL=0` by default; pass `--allow-eval` (or set the env var) to re-enable. Pair with `SL_DBG_AUDIT_LOG` when enabling. | #53 / #54 |
| `SL_DBG_DENY_EVAL_PATTERNS` | Colon-separated substring deny list for `debug_eval` expressions, applied **after** `SL_DBG_ALLOW_EVAL=1` lets the call through. Default hardcoded list blocks the obvious Java side-effect classes (`FileOutputStream`, `Runtime.getRuntime`, …). Set to `-` to disable. **Not a security boundary** — trivially bypassable via reflection / dunder traversal / `getattr`. Kept only as a typo-guard convenience. | #19 / #54 |
| `SL_DBG_INSECURE` | When set to `1`, `sl-dbg mcp` will start without `--safe`, restoring legacy permissive defaults. Prints a loud startup banner listing the open guards. **Not for unattended LLM use.** | #53 |
| `SL_DBG_PPROF` | Diagnostic-only. When set to a bind address (e.g. `:6060` or `127.0.0.1:6060`), the daemon serves Go's standard `net/http/pprof` endpoints on that address. Off by default — never bind a port unless explicitly opted in. Useful for capturing heap / goroutine snapshots when investigating leaks. | #45 |

The daemon also sources `$XDG_STATE_HOME/sl-dbg/safe-policy.env` (or `~/.local/state/sl-dbg/safe-policy.env`) at startup. This file is written by `sl-dbg mcp --safe` so a daemon respawned by an unrelated CLI invocation (which lacks the `SL_DBG_*` env vars the safe process exported) still loads the operator's safe policy. Pre-existing environment variables take precedence over the file. Only keys prefixed with `SL_DBG_` are honoured. Issue #69.

## Schema / Versioning Policy

Every JSON response includes a `"schema": "1"` marker. The contract for `schema:"1"`:

1. **Additive only.** New optional fields may appear at any time; existing field names, JSON types, and `error.code` values will not change meaning.
2. **Removed fields are NOT re-introduced** with a different meaning. If a field is dropped (because the data is no longer accurate, e.g. `location` on an `exited` session), it stays dropped.
3. **`schema` will bump to `"2"`** only for an intentional breaking change announced ahead in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Tools should pin to a schema and warn on unknown values.

## Adapter Capability Notes

| Adapter | Restart supported | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Java (java-debug) | ❌ no | JDI/JDWP cannot hot-restart a JVM. Use `sl-dbg stop` then `sl-dbg start` with the same args. `debug_restart` returns `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE`. |
| Python (debugpy) | ✅ yes | |
| Go (delve) | ✅ yes | |
